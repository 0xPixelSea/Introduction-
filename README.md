# Introduction-

Pixelsea is more than just a marketplace—it’s an ecosystem that empowers users to trade NFTs on multiple blockchains seamlessly. Recognizing the limitations of existing NFT platforms, Pixelsea was developed to create a truly decentralized environment where creators, collectors, and investors can interact . An artist looking to reach a broader audience or a collector seeking to diversify your digital assets, Pixelsea offers a platform that caters user  needs.

Pixelsea’s multi-chain functionality is a game-changer in the NFT world. Unlike single-chain marketplaces that restrict users to a specific blockchain, Pixelsea allows for the trading of NFTs on various chains, including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polygon, and more. This multi-chain approach ensures that users are not limited by the blockchain they prefer, opening up new possibilities for on-chain transactions and collaborations.

a) Support for All EVM-Compatible Chains:

Pixelsea’s support for all EVM-compatible chains is a key differentiator. By integrating multiple blockchains into a single platform, Pixelsea provides users with the ability to choose the chain that best suits their needs—whether it's for lower transaction fees, faster processing times, or specific community preferences. This flexibility not only enhances the user experience but also fosters a more interconnected NFT ecosystem, where assets can flow freely between different blockchains.

b) Custom Token Support:

In addition to its multi-chain capabilities, Pixelsea also supports custom tokens, further enhancing its versatility. Users can trade NFTs using tokens that are specific to their preferred blockchain, such as ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum or BEP-20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain. This custom token support allows for greater flexibility in transactions, enabling users to utilize the tokens they hold, without the need to convert them into a platform’s native token. For instance, users can trade NFTs using a token like ‘Usdt Usdc , Wbtc , Wsol and more  on the Ethereum chain oas well as  on BSC, reflecting the unique preferences and strategies of each user.

By combining multi-chain functionality with custom token support, Pixelsea offers a comprehensive solution that addresses the current limitations of the NFT marketplace. It is designed to empower users with the freedom to choose, trade, and interact within a borderless digital ecosystem, making it a pioneer in the next generation of NFT platforms. Pixelsea is not just a marketplace; it’s the future of NFT trading.
